For a data period (a day), break it up into 10 pieces. 
Sample the data at those points

Data here means value * volume
Or
Value change / avg volume in that time period: 

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9


to obtain 9 slopes

Sum up all the positive slopes
Sum up all the negative slopes

Slope = pos + neg	; Slope shows the average direction
Distance = pos + abs(neg)	; Used to calculate the extreme directions


higher distance means more instability, lower means stability. Distance is the equivalent of velocity. It's just a quantity, not a vector quantity...

Higher distance = more instability, less confidence
If the actual slope matches the distance, then the direction is definite...

for a small data set: (assuming volume and all other factors stayed the same...)

100 110 120 130
Slope:
10 10 10

CombinedSlope: 30
Distance: 30
avg slope: 10

30-30: 0

Max Slope: avgSlope + 0
minSlope: avgSlope - 0

120 110 120 130
Slope:
-10 10 10

Combined: 20 (easily found by doing last - first)
Distance: 30
avg: 2/3 = 6.67

instability = 30 - 20 = 10

max Slope: 16.67
min Slope: -4.67
avg Slope: 6


next max: 146.67
*next probable: 136
next min: 125.33

Look at next probable...
Use next min as risk reduction...
